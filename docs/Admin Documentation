$noNavbar => I created this variable to differs between the pages(files) that have navbar and those how don't have.
How it works ? 
In the init.php file , We have an If condition -> If there is $noNavbar in the page then hide the navbar Else show the navbar 


$pageTitle => I created this variable to give each page its title
How it works ? 
We created a function which checks for $pageTitle if it is exists then it will echo it in the page title otherwise it will echo Default
